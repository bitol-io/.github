## Welcome to Bitol 👋

Bitol represents a constant iterative process that symbolizes evolution. Our mission is to foster a set of standards to define data contracts, data products, and more in order to tackle multiple data engineering challenges, such as data normalization, ensuring the relevance of documentation, establishing service-level expectations, simplifying data and tool integration, and promoting a data product-oriented approach.
